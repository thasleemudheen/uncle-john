                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Synonym for splendid sweetness, Uncle John reigns the world of ice creams today. This most celebrated ice cream brand was named thus as a tribute to Mr. M C John, who made his own kingdom of ice creams in Kerala five decades back in 1972.
                        Serving Kerala State Government as a Senior Bureaucrat for a long period, Mr. M C John took the great step of pursuing his dream to become an entrepreneur after voluntary retirement and transformed into an ‘Icon of Ice Cream Industry’ in due course.
                        After establishing South India's pioneering ice cream brand - Uncle John, new brand additions like Skei were introduced in the coming years by Kreemfoods (P) Ltd founded by himself. Uncle John immediately became a fast-selling ice cream brand with outstanding taste and impeccable quality.
                        Headquartered in Kochi, Uncle John continues its supremacy in the ice cream industry with 13 factories spanning across India over the past 50 years. Uncle John also has an overseas brand impact through its operations and production cantered in Africa.</p>
